## Highlights
- Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) usually presents two modalities on video frames at the same time, i.e. ultrasound part and contrast-enhanced part.
- We can determine a rough location for lesion on ultrasound part and then finely sketch the region of interest on contrast-enhanced part.
- In this way, a video segmentation task can be converted into a frame segmentation task.

Our work can achieve a comparable performance with clinicians on breast lesion and cervical lymphadenopathy segmentation task. More details can refer to our paper.
